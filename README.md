## ✨ Features

### 🍏 Native macOS Presence
- **Menu Bar Companion**: Mirror your remaining time directly in the macOS menu bar for glanceable tracking.
- **Floating Popup**: Popover-style interface that stays on top when you need it without stealing focus.
- **Global Shortcuts**: Toggle visibility from anywhere with `⌥⇧P` (Option+Shift+P).
- **Space-Aware**: The timer follows you across Mission Control spaces automatically.

### 📊 Integrated Analytics & Tasks
- **Task Focused**: A slide-up "Task Shelf" to manage your session goals without distraction.
- **Project Tagging**: Categorize your focus sessions with project-level tags to see where your time goes.
- **Deep Insights**: Detailed bar charts, project distribution donuts, and streak tracking.
- **Native Persistence**: Your logs and tasks are saved to the native macOS layer (`UserDefaults`), surviving updates and restarts.
